**Overview**
This repository contains practical example of Vanishing Gradient Problem in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks help to mitigate this issue.

I have created a sample text data , then I convert text to numerical token to feed into machine learning model

Afterthat I have created two model RNNs & LSTM , where we can see  difference between gradient behaviour of two model.
